    <h1>The Vietnam war</h1>
    <p>The Vietnam War started when Ho Chi Minh 
        communist forces took power in Northern 
        Vietnam on November 1, 1955. Because of 
        that, the armed conflict between the Northern
        Vietnam army and Southern Vietnam army continued
        until the Northern Vietnam victory at the battle
        of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. France lost the 
        battle of Dien Bien Phu, and with their loss, 
        the French colonies rule in Indochina came to 
        an end. With the battle of Dien Bien Phu coming 
        to an end, a treaty was signed in July 1954 at 
        the Geneva conference to split Vietnam along the 
        latitude 17th parallel. The agreement resulted in 
        a way that would make Ho in control of North Vietnam 
        and Bao in control of South Vietnam. By 1955, a strong 
        anti-communist politician and catholic nationalist, 
        Ngo Dinh Diem became the president of the Republic 
        of Vietnam, thus pushing aside Bao Emperor. Ngo Dinh 
        Diem was the leader of southern Vietnam. Also, by 1955, 
        president of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower 
        pledged his support to the Diem government and South 
        Vietnam. Later in May 1959, Northern Vietnam forcefully 
        began to build a supply route to support the guerrilla 
        attacks against the Diem's government in South Vietnam. 
        The route known as Ho Chi Minh Trail was built through 
        Cambodia and Laos. The trail is then greatly enhanced 
        during the Vietnam war. In July of 1959, the first US 
        soldiers were killed during a guerilla reign on the US 
        soldier’s living quarters near the city of Saigon.</p>

    <h1>The bhuddist protest</h1>
    <p>Not all the action is at the battleground; 
        there are violent acts by the Vietcong government 
        and the Vietcong army. South Vietnam troops enforced
        a ban on the Buddhist multicolour flag. This incident 
        later resulted in a violent and intensive protest by 
        Buddhists against the government. The South Vietnamese 
        government was Catholic and the Buddhists were not supporters 
        of the Vietcong and were unhappy with the Catholic domination 
        of their country.</p> 
    <p>In May 1963, the 2527th birthday of Buddha, thousands of 
        Buddhists gathered in Hue to celebrate it, but the governor 
        of Hue was a Catholic and despised the flying of the Buddhist 
        flag. Since the Vietcong government banned the flying of the 
        Buddhist flag, thousands of Buddhists gathered at a radio 
        station to hear the address of the Buddhist leader, but the 
        manager of that radio station cancelled the broadcast. The 
        local governor, Major XI, sent five armoured vehicles to the 
        scene. The commander of the vehicles demanded that the crowd 
        of people disperse, but later told his men to open fire on the 
        crowd. People panicked, resulting in the death of one woman and 
        eight children. Soon after that, the Buddhist people demanded an 
        investigation into the matter, but the governor just placed all 
        the blame on the Vietcong despite all the evidence. The Buddhist 
        people held multiple demonstrations due to the government not taking 
        responsibility for the shooting that took place in Hue. </p>
    <p>In June 1963, an old Buddhist monk named Quan Duc set himself on fire. 
        This event took place in the busy streets of Saigon. Duc climbed out 
        of a car and he sat down in an open space where the other monks surrounded 
        him. Another monk doused Duc with gasoline and lit him on fire. The monk 
        clasped his hand due to the pain, and soon the fire spread throughout his 
        body, a slow and painful death. With his last dying word, he said to the 
        South Vietnam leaders to show respect for all religions. Demonstrations 
        continued in hue for how the south president Ngi Dinh Diems has refused a 
        proper investigation on the Hue shooting. Ngo Dinh Nhu, brother of Ngi Dinh 
        Diems was furious with the demonstration made by the Buddhists and so he 
        decided to attack the Buddhist temple. Ngi Dinh Diems, who supports his 
        brother’s actions, had decided to pin the blame on the parts of the army. 
        On August 21, 1963, Nhu’s men attacked the main Buddha temple in Saigon, 
        Xa Loi. The Nhu’s men surrounded and attacked the temple, raiding and 
        arresting the people. On that day, 400 people were arrested including an 
        80-year-old patriarch. Similar incidents took place all around South Vietnam, 
        where Buddhist temples were raided and people were arrested by Nhu’s 
        forces.</p>
