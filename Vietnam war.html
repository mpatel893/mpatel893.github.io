                <h1><b>Vietnam War</b></h1>
                <p>The Vietnam war lasted a great period of time. The war was between the communist government of North Vietnam and the leaders of South Vietnam and their allies, mainly the United States. The Vietnam war intensified greatly during the cold war conflict between the united states and the soviet union. When the war came to an end the damage was much too great to comprehend, more than 3 million people lost their lives of those people 58,000 were Americans,  and more than half of those people were Vietnam civilians. This conflict not only divided a nation but also divided Americans, even after President Richard Nixon withdrew the US forces. The was officially came to an end when communist North Vietnam took </p>

                <p>Vietnam prior to the war was a french occupied land, the French had ruled Vietnam from the 19th century. When the Japanese invaded during world war 2 they freed Vietnam from French colonialism. During that time there was a political leader named Ho Chi Minh, which was influenced by Chinese and Soviet communism, he created the Viet Minh or the league which would bring independence to Vietnam. After 1945, the Japanese forces have been defeated in world war 2 and starting to withdraw their forces from Vietnam, this left Vietnam in the hands of Bao Dai, a french educated Emporer. But Ho’s forces had other plans, with this opening they quickly moved and took over the northern city of Hanoi and declared it as the democratic republic of Vietnam with Ho as president. </p>
                <p>After the world war ended french were seeking to regain control of Vietnam so in hopes of doing that they back up Emperor Bao. in July 1949 France set up a state of Vietnam with Saigon as its capital. Both Ho Chi Mink and Boa wanded the same thing to unify Vietnam but the difference was that boa wanted Vietnam closer economically and culturally tied to the west, Ho wanted Vietnam to be communist.</p>

                <p>There is no real date when the Vietnam war started since the conflict in the region stretched back to several decades but the conflict intensified when U.S. active involvement began in 1954. The Vietnam War started when Ho Chi Minh communist forces took power in Northern Vietnam on November 1, 1955. Because of that, the armed conflict between the Northern Vietnam army and Southern Vietnam army continued until the Northern Vietnam victory at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. France lost the battle of Dien Bien Phu, and with their loss, the French colonies rule in Indochina came to an end. With the battle of Dien Bien Phu coming to an end, a treaty was signed in July 1954 at the Geneva conference to split Vietnam along the latitude 17th parallel. The agreement resulted in a way that would make Ho in control of North Vietnam and Bao in control of South Vietnam. By 1955, a strong anti-communist politician and catholic nationalist, Ngo Dinh Diem, became the president of the Republic of Vietnam, thus pushing aside Bao Emperor. Ngo Dinh Diem was the leader of southern Vietnam. Also, by 1955, president of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower pledged his support to the Diem government and South Vietnam. </p>

                <p>With the cold war intensifying worldwide, the United States hardened its policies for any allies of the soviet union. By 1955, the president of the united states, Dwight D. Eisenhower, had pledged to support Diem and South Vietnam. The training and equipment from the U.S. military and the CIA, Diem’s security forces cracked down on Viet Minh supporters, arresting some 100,000 people many of them were tortured and executed. By 1957, the Viet Cong and other opponents of Diem’s repressive regime began to fight back and by 1959 they got into a  firefight with the South Vietnam army. In December 1960, the opponent of Diem, communist and non-communists formed the National Liberation Front(NLF) to organize the resistance of the regime.</p>

Kennedy sent a team to report on the condition in South Vietnam which they advised that economically, technical aid, and build-up of the American military in order to help the Diem fight the Viet Cong. the “Domino theory” stated that if one Southeast Asia country falls in the hands of communists than many other countries would soon follow. Kennedy did not want to find a bigger battel later when communists had spread to another country in southeastern Asia so by providing U.S. Aid to the opponent of communist they could stop the spread of communism at an early stage so he wouldn’t have to commit a large-scale military attack. By 1962, U.S. Military troops stationed in South Vietnam had reached a number of 9,000 troops.</p>

After the assassination of John F.  Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. The political instability in South Vietnam led Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy’s successor, and Robert McNamara, secretary of defence, to increase U.S. military and economic support to South Vietnam.</p>

Between 1964-973 The united states secretly dropped 3 million Bombs on the neighbouring country, natural Laos during the CIA-led "secret war " in Laos. The Purpose of the Bombing was to stop/disrupt the flow of supplies between Laos and Vietnam. Pathet Lao a communist leader who was supporting the Vietnam communist by sending supplies through the Ho Chi Minh trail and due to that us made Lao the most bombed country per capita in the world</p>
                <p>March 1965, As the war progressed Johnson made a decision to send us combat forces into the battle of Vietnam, this decision was solidly supported by the American majority. By June 82,000 combat troops were sent to Vietnam and stationed there, but by the end of 1965 another 175,00o troops more will be stationed to help the struggling south Vietnam army. But not all Americans were fond of the idea of war, during the war the anti-war movement grew, Johnson will commit another 200,000 men by the end of 1966, and not just America but many different countries like South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, committed troops to fight in South Vietnam although at a much smaller scale.</p>

                <p>While bombing and another method of the fight were there, but the main way of fighting was by ground, and in charge of the ground battles were the general William Westmoreland, in coordination with the government of General Nguyen Van Thieu in Saigon. When many other generals had the policy of capturing as much land as possible, William Westmoreland had the policy of killing as many enemy soldiers as possible. By 1966, many areas of South Vietnam were labelled as “free-fire zone”. But even when the enemy body count was rising, the Viet Cong refused to give up encouraged by the fact that they could reoccupy the land with he help form more manpower, supplies delivered through the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and support of Cambodia, Laos, China, and the soviet union.</p>

Although the U.S. and South Vietnam were surprised by the Tet offensive, they were able to counter-attack quickly and efficiently, and the communists were unable to hold the target for more than a day or two.</p>
                <p>Reports of the Tet operation stunned Americans, and what stunned more was that general William Westmoreland requested 200,000 troops, even though they assured it that victory in the Vietnam war was imminent. With this, the ratting dropped in an election year, Johnson called a halt to bombing in much of North Vietnam and promised to solve the situation through peace in full terms.</p>

                <p> Nixon thought the anti-war movement through appealing to a small majority of Americans who supported the war effort. In an attempt to cut down of american casualties they put a program  in place, the program was called vietnamization, the program withdrew american troops but increased aerial and artillery bombing and gave the south vietnmanese forces better training and better equipment to fight efficiently on the ground. Besides the vietnamization program, Nixon continued peace talk in Paris, and high-level secret  talks by secretary of state Henry Kissinger beginning in the spring of 1968.</p>
                <p>The north vietnmaes demande that in order for the peace talk to take place their conditions where that america completely withdraws from this war and the expulsion of General Nguyen Van Thieu, but due to the condition the peace talks resulted in a hang back.</p>

The anti-war movement divided Americans to two sides; one side saw that going against the government was like treason, and for others the war seemed like it was unrestrained authority which they resented.</p>
                <p>Due to this many soldiers were withdrawn from the war and other soldiers who were not withdrawn were angry and frustrated. Many as tens and thousands of soldiers were dishonorably discharged for desertion. 500,000 men became draft dodgers and  fled to canada to evade conscription after which Nixon ended the draft.</p>
