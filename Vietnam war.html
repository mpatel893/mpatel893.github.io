  <h2>Vietnam War</h2>
  <p>
    <P>The Vietnam War started when Ho Chi Minh 
      communist forces took power in Northern 
      Vietnam on November 1, 1955. Because of 
      that, the armed conflict between the Northern
      Vietnam army and Southern Vietnam army continued
      until the Northern Vietnam victory at the battle
      of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. France lost the 
      battle of Dien Bien Phu, and with their loss, 
      the French colonies rule in Indochina came to 
      an end. With the battle of Dien Bien Phu coming 
      to an end, a treaty was signed in July 1954 at 
      the Geneva conference to split Vietnam along the 
      latitude 17th parallel. The agreement resulted in 
      a way that would make Ho in control of North Vietnam 
      and Bao in control of South Vietnam. By 1955, a strong 
      anti-communist politician and catholic nationalist, 
      Ngo Dinh Diem became the president of the Republic 
      of Vietnam, thus pushing aside Bao Emperor. Ngo Dinh 
      Diem was the leader of southern Vietnam. Also, by 1955, 
      president of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower 
      pledged his support to the Diem government and South 
      Vietnam. Later in May 1959, Northern Vietnam forcefully 
      began to build a supply route to support the guerrilla 
      attacks against the Diem's government in South Vietnam. 
      The route known as Ho Chi Minh Trail was built through 
      Cambodia and Laos. The trail is then greatly enhanced 
      during the Vietnam war. In July of 1959, the first US 
      soldiers were killed during a guerilla reign on the US 
      soldierâ€™s living quarters near the city of Saigon.</P>
