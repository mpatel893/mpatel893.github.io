    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <h2>Buddhist Protest</h2>
    <p>Not all the action is at the battleground; 
      there are violent acts by the Vietcong government 
      and the Vietcong army. South Vietnam troops enforced
      a ban on the Buddhist multicolour flag. This incident 
      later resulted in a violent and intensive protest by 
      Buddhists against the government. The South Vietnamese 
      government was Catholic and the Buddhists were not supporters 
      of the Vietcong and were unhappy with the Catholic domination 
      of their country.
    </p> 
  <p>In May 1963, the 2527th birthday of Buddha, thousands of 
      Buddhists gathered in Hue to celebrate it, but the governor 
      of Hue was a Catholic and despised the flying of the Buddhist 
      flag. Since the Vietcong government banned the flying of the 
      Buddhist flag, thousands of Buddhists gathered at a radio 
      station to hear the address of the Buddhist leader, but the 
      manager of that radio station cancelled the broadcast. The 
      local governor, Major XI, sent five armoured vehicles to the 
      scene. The commander of the vehicles demanded that the crowd 
      of people disperse, but later told his men to open fire on the 
      crowd. People panicked, resulting in the death of one woman and 
      eight children. Soon after that, the Buddhist people demanded an 
      investigation into the matter, but the governor just placed all 
      the blame on the Vietcong despite all the evidence. The Buddhist 
      people held multiple demonstrations due to the government not taking 
      responsibility for the shooting that took place in Hue. 
    </p>
  <p>In June 1963, an old Buddhist monk named Quan Duc set himself on fire. 
      This event took place in the busy streets of Saigon. Duc climbed out 
      of a car and he sat down in an open space where the other monks surrounded 
      him. Another monk doused Duc with gasoline and lit him on fire. The monk 
      clasped his hand due to the pain, and soon the fire spread throughout his 
      body, a slow and painful death. With his last dying word, he said to the 
      South Vietnam leaders to show respect for all religions. Demonstrations 
      continued in hue for how the south president Ngi Dinh Diems has refused a 
      proper investigation on the Hue shooting. Ngo Dinh Nhu, brother of Ngi Dinh 
      Diems was furious with the demonstration made by the Buddhists and so he 
      decided to attack the Buddhist temple. Ngi Dinh Diems, who supports his 
      brother’s actions, had decided to pin the blame on the parts of the army. 
      On August 21, 1963, Nhu’s men attacked the main Buddha temple in Saigon, 
      Xa Loi. The Nhu’s men surrounded and attacked the temple, raiding and 
      arresting the people. On that day, 400 people were arrested including an 
      80-year-old patriarch. Similar incidents took place all around South Vietnam, 
      where Buddhist temples were raided and people were arrested by Nhu’s 
      forces.
